**idea of the program:**

I struggle to find nice looking wallpapers to apply on my super power desktop, since many wallpapers are not nice looking. Windows 10 spotlight wallpapers however, often brings me some awesome looking wallpapers. But they will get automatically deleted by the system after several days and if there happens to be an awesome wallpaper, it could be a loss. Another problem is it's hard to locate where they are on windows os, even if I find them, they actually have no file extensions, meaning I have to manually rename them to ".png" so that my photo viewer can actually view them. This is hard and repetitive process, which is not desirable based of a programmer's perspective (bug creator's perspective). So the idea of this program is simple, extract all the spotlight wallpapers and put them in a convenient location, renaming them by providing them new names and file extensions, and also filter them by their resolution - since not all of them are actually qualified wallpapers. Finally with the help of this little program, I can peacefully enjoy the wallpapers and make my desktop look good!
